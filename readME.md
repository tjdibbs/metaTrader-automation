# MetaTrader Python Programming

This directory contained both notebook version and file version of MetaTrader Interaction. Notebook version might give you much more clear understanding about what is implemented in this directory

Note: If you are to run this program using the [main.py](./main.py) file, you might need to configure some part of the code to your taste. So sorry it doesn't contain full documentation

### Directory Layout

- [ ] Find the main Bot file in the lib directory [auto.py](lib/auto.py)
- [ ] [Output.txt](output.txt) - for showing some info while running the SMA_CROSSOVER through the [main.py](./main.py)
- [ ] [Settings.json](setting.json) - you can save you required MetaTrader Credentials in it.

- [ ] [backtest-3-in-a-row-candles.ipynb](./backtest-3-in-a-row-candles.ipynb) - []



##### While this may not be the conventional way to write the program, it can still provide you with valuable insights and knowledge on how to communicate with MetaTrader using the Python MetaTrader Module.
